# Visual Studio Snippet Converter

<img src="SnippetConverterIcon.png" height=200>

This is a small hacky project to convert Visual Studio Code Snippets (XML .snippet files) to:

* VS Code Code Snippets
* Rider Live Templates

It consists of a library that can take individual Visual Studio snippets or a folder full of `.snippet` files, and create `.code-snippet` file with the snippets in VS Code, or create the appropriate live templates for JetBrains Rider and add it to the default configuration file. 

In VS Code the snippets are updated if they exist, in Rider Snippets can only be added to the global configuration (ie. you end up duplicating if you run multiple times).

This tooling provides both the library and a .NET Core Console application and .NET Core Tooling package.

### Using the .NET Core Console Application
The easiest way to use this tool is to install the dotnet tool from NuGet:

> **The package is not available yet!**

```ps
install-package dotnet-snippetconverter
```

**Requires:**  
[.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/downloadhttps://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later

Once installed you should able to run:

```ps
snippetconverter
```

from the Console.

Alternately, if you just use the source code to compile the project, you can use


```
dotnet run
```

from the project folder.

Or in the publish folder:

```
snippetconverter
```

### Use at your own Risk
This is a very rough project I created to just get the job of converting my CSharp, HTML and JavaScript templates between environments. I make no guarantees that it'll move all types of snippets nor that it will capture all features of the snippets. However, it works very well for my use case which has been able to easily migrate all of my Visual Studio snippets to both VS Code and Rider.
 
Your mileage may vary!
